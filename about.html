            <h2 class="mainh">What you should know…</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="bout">The best diet is the one you will stick to. You will almost always lose weight if you eat fewer calories than
            you burn, and gain weight if you do the opposite. Different eating styles, however, can make it easier to
            reach your goals. Low carb eating styles such as Keto and Paleo can make it much easier to feel full, and
            thus eat fewer calories. But if you're good about controlling your portioning, it's less necessary to
            restrict your food choices, and you may have an easier time sticking to your plan.
            Everyone is different, so the best thing you can do is experiment and see what works for you.

            <h2 class="mainh">What is Body Mass Index?</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="bout">One of the easiest ways to assess if you are healthy weight is to measure your body mass index (BMI). The BMI
            is a calculation of your weight in relation to your height. BMI is an inexpensive and easy screening method
            for weight category—underweight, healthy weight, overweight, and obesity.
            BMI does not measure body fat directly, but BMI is moderately correlated with more direct measures of body
            fat. Furthermore, BMI appears to be as strongly correlated with various metabolic and disease outcomes as
            are these more direct measures of body fatness.

            <h2 class="mainh">What are Calories?</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="bout">The definition of a calorie is the amount of energy necessary to raise the temperature of 1 gram (g) of water
            through 1° Celsius.
            The type and amount of food people eat determine how many calories they consume. If a person consistently
            consumes more energy than they require, they will gain weight. Similarly, if they consume less, they will
            lose weight, fat, and eventually muscle mass.
            In order to maintain your weight, you need to make sure that you don’t consume more calories than you expand
            daily. Spending as many calories as you take in is the concept behind energy balance. Energy is another word
            for "calories." Your energy balance is the balance of calories consumed through eating and drinking compared
            to calories burned through physical activity. What you eat and drink is ENERGY IN. What you burn through
            physical activity is ENERGY OUT.

            <h2 class="mainh">The relationship of Calorie intake to Body Mass Index?</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="bout">Calories and BMI (Body Mass Index) are related through the balance of energy intake and expenditure and their impact on body weight.</p>
            <br>
         <h4 class="subh">Impact of Caloric Intake on BMI Categories:</h4>
                <p class="bout"> • Underweight (BMI < 18.5): May result from insufficient caloric intake. Normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9):</p>
                <p class="bout"> • Results from a balanced caloric intake matching the body's energy expenditure. Overweight (BMI 25-29.9):</p>
                <p class="bout"> • Often due to a consistent caloric surplus. Obese (BMI ≥ 30): Generally a result of prolonged caloric</p>
                <p class="bout"> • surplus leading to significant weight gain.</p>
